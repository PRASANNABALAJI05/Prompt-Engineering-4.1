# Prompt-Engineering-4.1
# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description: 
## Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

## Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in different use cases.

## **Algorithm**

1. **Define Use Case Scenarios**
   Identify 5 specific situations where MediGuide interacts with elderly patients:

   * A. Medication Reminder
   * B. Diet Advice for Diabetes
   * C. Joint Pain Query (Arthritis)
   * D. Hypertension Monitoring Tip
   * E. Emotional Support (Loneliness)

2. **Select Prompting Techniques**
   Prepare prompt variants for each scenario using:

   * **Zero-shot prompting**
   * **Few-shot prompting**
   * **Chain-of-thought prompting**
   * **Role-based prompting**
   * **Multi-modal prompting** (only for platforms that support images/voice/text)

3. **Design Prompt Templates**
   For each technique:

   * Craft one unique prompt per scenario.
   * Ensure clarity and consistency in input.

4. **Run Prompts Through AI Models**
   Use a consistent AI platform (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) or compare across platforms.

   * Input each prompt.
   * Collect responses.
   * Log response time, content quality, and tone.

5. **Evaluate Responses**
   For each response, evaluate on:

   * **Relevance** (Is it on-topic?)
   * **Clarity** (Easy to understand?)
   * **Empathy** (Especially for emotional support)
   * **Personalization** (Tailored to elderly user?)
   * **Actionability** (Can the user follow the advice?)

6. **Tabulate Results**
   Create a table to compare prompting techniques across scenarios and performance metrics.

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Zero-shot        | *"I'm feeling lonely today. What should I do?"*                                                        | "I'm here for you. Maybe call a friend or take a walk. You're not alone."                                                             | Brief, helpful but generic         |
| Few-shot         | *"User: I feel isolated. System: It’s okay to feel that way. Try calling someone you trust..."*        | "I understand. Why not call your daughter today? A little talk can brighten your mood!"                                               | More warm and personalized         |
| Chain-of-thought | *"Break down the emotional state and suggest steps: Feeling lonely → Isolation → Need for connection"* | "Since you're feeling lonely, it might help to connect with someone you care about. Would you like me to remind you to call someone?" | Thoughtful and logical response    |
| Role-based       | *"You are a compassionate caregiver. Respond to a lonely elderly patient."*                            | "Oh dear, I know some days can feel heavy. But I’m always here for you. Let’s do something together!"                                 | High empathy, very comforting      |
| Multi-modal      | *Image of sunset + voice message saying “I feel lonely”*                                               | "What a beautiful sunset. Let's enjoy it together. I’m always here to talk if you need someone."                                      | Touches on visual & emotional cues |

### **Conclusion / Best Practices**

* **Role-based** and **Chain-of-thought** prompting provide the most empathetic and useful interactions.
* **Few-shot** works well for personalization when training examples are available.
* **Multi-modal** prompts shine in emotionally rich or visually contextual situations.
* **Zero-shot** is fast and simple but often lacks depth or emotional nuance.
